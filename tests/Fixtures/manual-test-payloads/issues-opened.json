    "body": "## Problem\n\nCurrently, webhook handlers can only use REST API calls. This limits the ability to perform complex operations that would benefit from GraphQL's powerful query capabilities.\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nAdd support for GraphQL mutations within webhook event handlers. This would allow:\n\n- Adding labels to issues using GraphQL\n- Creating comments with rich formatting\n- Batch operations for multiple resources\n- Reduced API call overhead\n\n## Example Use Case\n\n```csharp\n// In a webhook handler\nawait github.GraphQL.MutateAsync(\n  mutation: AddLabelsToLabelableMutation,\n  variables: new { labelableId = issue.NodeId, labelIds = [\"label1\", \"label2\"] }\n);\n```\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] GraphQL client adapter supports mutations\n- [ ] Webhook handlers can access GraphQL client via dependency injection\n- [ ] Error handling for GraphQL-specific errors (schema validation, rate limits)\n- [ ] Documentation and examples provided\n\n## Related Issues\n\n#38, #39",
