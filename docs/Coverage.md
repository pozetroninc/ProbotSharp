## Overview

ProbotSharp uses a comprehensive coverage suite that provides:

- **Line Coverage**: Percentage of code lines executed by tests
- **Branch Coverage**: Percentage of decision branches (if/else, switch) covered
- **Method Coverage**: Percentage of methods called at least once
- **Per-layer Analysis**: Separate metrics for Domain, Application, Infrastructure layers
- **Historical Tracking**: Coverage trends over time
- **CI/CD Integration**: Automated coverage in GitHub Actions with PR comments

### Technology Stack

- **Coverlet**: .NET code coverage collection
- **ReportGenerator**: HTML report generation and analysis
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD automation
- **Codecov** (optional): Cloud-based coverage tracking

## Quick Start

### Using Make Commands (Recommended)

```bash
# Run full coverage analysis
make coverage

# Run per-layer coverage
make coverage-layer

# Watch mode for development
make coverage-watch

# Open HTML report in browser
make coverage-report
```

### Using Scripts Directly

```bash
# Run full coverage
./scripts/coverage/run-coverage-all.sh

# Run per-layer analysis
./scripts/coverage/run-coverage-by-layer.sh

# Analyze coverage gaps
./scripts/coverage/analyze-coverage-gaps.sh
```

## Coverage Goals

ProbotSharp follows a tiered coverage strategy based on architectural layers:

| Layer | Line Coverage Target | Branch Coverage Target | Rationale |
|-------|---------------------|------------------------|-----------|
| **Domain** | 90% | 85% | Core business logic, must be thoroughly tested |
| **Application** | 80% | 75% | Use cases and orchestration logic |
| **Infrastructure** | 70% | 65% | External integrations, often tested via integration tests |
| **Adapters** | 70% | 65% | HTTP/CLI/Worker adapters |
| **Shared** | 85% | 80% | Common utilities and extensions |
| **Bootstrap** | 60% | 50% | Composition root, mainly configuration |
| **Overall** | 80% | 75% | Project-wide minimum target |

## Running Coverage Locally

### Prerequisites

1. Install .NET tools:
   ```bash
   dotnet tool restore
   ```

2. Build the solution:
   ```bash
   dotnet build --configuration Release
   ```

### Full Coverage Analysis

Run complete coverage for all projects:

```bash
make coverage
```

This will:
1. Run all tests with coverage collection
2. Generate HTML reports with branch coverage
3. Display summary in terminal
4. Open report in browser (if available)

Output locations:
- HTML Report: `coverage-report/index.html`
- Cobertura XML: `coverage-report/Cobertura.xml`
- Coverage Badge: `coverage-report/badge_combined.svg`

### Per-Layer Coverage

Analyze coverage for each architectural layer separately:

```bash
make coverage-layer
```

This generates individual reports:
- Domain: `coverage-report-Domain/index.html`
- Application: `coverage-report-Application/index.html`
- Infrastructure: `coverage-report-Infrastructure/index.html`
- And more...

Each layer is evaluated against its specific thresholds, and the script will fail if any layer is below its target.

### Watch Mode

For continuous feedback during development:

```bash
make coverage-watch
# Or specify a target:
./scripts/coverage/run-coverage-watch.sh domain
```

Watch mode:
- Monitors file changes
- Re-runs coverage automatically
- Updates HTML report in real-time
- Shows coverage metrics in terminal

### Coverage Comparison

Compare coverage between branches:

```bash
# Save current coverage snapshot
make coverage-snapshot

# Compare with main branch
make coverage-compare

# Show coverage trend over time
make coverage-trend
```

## Understanding Coverage Reports

### HTML Report Navigation

The HTML report (`coverage-report/index.html`) provides:

1. **Summary Page**
   - Overall coverage percentages
   - Coverage by assembly
   - Risk hotspots (low coverage + high complexity)

2. **Assembly View**
   - Class-level coverage
   - Namespace breakdown
   - Coverage distribution chart

3. **Class View**
   - Method-level coverage
   - Line-by-line coverage visualization
   - Branch coverage indicators

4. **Source View**
   - Green lines: Covered code
   - Red lines: Uncovered code
   - Yellow lines: Partially covered branches
   - Numbers: Hit count for each line

### Coverage Metrics Explained

#### Line Coverage
Percentage of executable lines that were executed during tests.

```text
public class Calculator
{
    public int Calculate(int a, int b)  // âœ“ Covered if method is called
    {
        if (a > 0)                       // âœ“ Covered if reached
        {
            return a + b;                // âœ“ Covered if a > 0
        }
        return b;                        // âœ— Not covered if a always > 0 in tests
    }
}
```

#### Branch Coverage
Percentage of decision branches taken during tests.

```text
public class StatusChecker
{
    public string GetStatus(int value)
    {
        // Branch coverage requires testing both true AND false paths
        if (value > 100)      // Need tests for value > 100 AND value <= 100
        {
            return "High";
        }
        else if (value > 50)  // Need tests for value > 50 AND value <= 50
        {
            return "Medium";
        }
        return "Low";
    }
}
```

#### Method Coverage
Percentage of methods that were invoked at least once.

### Coverage Gaps Analysis

Run gap analysis to identify untested code:

```bash
make coverage-gaps
```

This generates `coverage-gaps.md` with:
- Files with low coverage (<50%)
- Uncovered methods list
- Priority recommendations
- Action items for improvement

## CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions Workflow

Coverage runs automatically on:
- Every push to main branch
- All pull requests
- When source code changes

#### Main CI Pipeline (.github/workflows/dotnet.yml)

- Runs tests with coverage collection
- Generates coverage report
- Uploads to Codecov (if configured)
- Creates coverage artifacts
- Displays summary in workflow

#### PR Coverage Report (.github/workflows/coverage-report.yml)

For pull requests, provides:
- Coverage comparison with base branch
- Automatic PR comment with metrics
- Pass/fail status based on thresholds
- Coverage delta visualization

Example PR comment:
```markdown
## ðŸ“Š Coverage Report

âœ… Coverage improved!

| Metric | Base Branch | This PR | Delta |
|--------|-------------|---------|-------|
| Line Coverage | 75.3% | 78.1% | ðŸ“ˆ +2.8% |
| Branch Coverage | 70.2% | 73.5% | ðŸ“ˆ +3.3% |
```

### Coverage Badges

Add coverage badges to README.md (after running coverage analysis):

```markdown
![Coverage Status](../coverage-report/badges/coverage-status.svg)
![Line Coverage](../coverage-report/badges/coverage-line.svg)
![Branch Coverage](../coverage-report/badges/coverage-branch.svg)
```

**Note:** These badges are generated automatically when running `make coverage-badges` after coverage collection. The badge files will be placed in the `coverage-report/badges/` directory.

## Improving Coverage

### Strategic Approach

1. **Focus on Domain Layer First**
   - Highest value for testing
   - Core business logic
   - Target: >90% coverage

2. **Test Critical Paths**
   - Authentication/Authorization
   - Data validation
   - Error handling
   - External API interactions

3. **Use Appropriate Test Types**
   - Unit tests for Domain/Application
   - Integration tests for Infrastructure
   - Contract tests for APIs

### Writing Effective Tests

#### Test All Branches

```text
using ProbotSharp.Shared.Abstractions;
using NUnit.Framework;

// Code under test
public class Calculator
{
    public Result<int> Divide(int a, int b)
    {
        if (b == 0)
            return Result<int>.Failure("DivisionByZero", "Cannot divide by zero");

        return Result<int>.Success(a / b);
    }
}

// Tests needed for full branch coverage
[TestFixture]
public class CalculatorTests
{
    private Calculator calculator = new Calculator();

    [Test]
    public void Divide_WithNonZeroDivisor_ReturnsSuccess()
    {
        var result = calculator.Divide(10, 2);
        Assert.IsTrue(result.IsSuccess);
        Assert.AreEqual(5, result.Value);
    }

    [Test]
    public void Divide_WithZeroDivisor_ReturnsFailure()
    {
        var result = calculator.Divide(10, 0);
        Assert.IsFalse(result.IsSuccess);
        Assert.AreEqual("DivisionByZero", result.Error.Code);
    }
}
```

#### Test Edge Cases

```text
using NUnit.Framework;

[TestFixture]
public class EdgeCaseTests
{
    [TestCase(int.MaxValue, 1)]      // Boundary values
    [TestCase(int.MinValue, -1)]     // Overflow scenarios
    [TestCase(0, 1)]                 // Zero handling
    [TestCase(-10, -2)]              // Negative numbers
    public void Calculate_EdgeCases(int a, int b)
    {
        // Test implementation
    }
}
```

#### Use Property-Based Testing

For value objects and specifications:

```text
using FsCheck;
using FsCheck.NUnit;

public class EmailAddress
{
    public string Value { get; }
    public EmailAddress(string value) => Value = value;
    public override bool Equals(object obj) => obj is EmailAddress other && Value == other.Value;
    public override int GetHashCode() => Value?.GetHashCode() ?? 0;
}

public class PropertyTests
{
    [Property]
    public Property EmailAddress_Equality_IsSymmetric()
    {
        return Prop.ForAll<string, string>((email1, email2) =>
        {
            var addr1 = new EmailAddress(email1);
            var addr2 = new EmailAddress(email2);
            return (addr1.Equals(addr2)) == (addr2.Equals(addr1));
        });
    }
}
```

### Excluding Code from Coverage

Some code should be excluded from coverage metrics:

#### In Source Code

```text
using System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis;

// Exclude entire class
[ExcludeFromCodeCoverage]
public class MigrationConfiguration { }

// Exclude specific method
public class Service
{
    [ExcludeFromCodeCoverage]
    public void DebugOnlyMethod() { }
}
```

#### In coverlet.runsettings

Already configured exclusions:
- Database migrations
- Auto-generated code
- Designer files
- Test assemblies

## Advanced Analysis

### Mutation Testing

Consider adding mutation testing to verify test quality:

```bash
dotnet tool install -g dotnet-stryker
dotnet stryker
```

### Cyclomatic Complexity

High complexity + low coverage = high risk:

```bash
# Identify complex methods needing tests
dotnet tool install -g dotnet-reportgenerator-globaltool
reportgenerator -reports:coverage.xml -targetdir:report -reporttypes:Html -riskhotspots
```

### Historical Tracking

Track coverage trends over time:

```bash
# Save snapshot after each significant change
./scripts/coverage/compare-coverage.sh snapshot

# View trend
./scripts/coverage/compare-coverage.sh trend
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### No Coverage Data Generated

**Problem**: Tests run but no coverage files created

**Solutions**:
- Ensure `coverlet.collector` package is installed in test projects
- Check `coverlet.runsettings` exists and is valid
- Verify `--collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"` parameter is present

#### Low Coverage Despite Many Tests

**Problem**: Coverage lower than expected

**Causes**:
- Tests not exercising all code paths
- Async code not being awaited properly
- Excluded files included in metrics
- Dead code that's never executed

**Solutions**:
- Review uncovered code in HTML report
- Add tests for edge cases and error paths
- Remove unreachable code
- Ensure async tests use proper assertions

#### Branch Coverage Lower Than Line Coverage

**Problem**: Good line coverage but poor branch coverage

**Solution**: Ensure tests cover all decision paths:

```text
public class NumberCategorizer
{
    // Needs 4 tests for full branch coverage
    public string Categorize(int? value)
    {
        if (value == null)           // Test: null
            return "Unknown";

        if (value < 0)               // Test: negative
            return "Negative";

        if (value > 0)               // Test: positive
            return "Positive";

        return "Zero";               // Test: zero
    }
}
```

#### Coverage Report Not Opening

**Problem**: Browser doesn't open automatically

**Solution**:
```bash
# Linux
xdg-open coverage-report/index.html

# macOS
open coverage-report/index.html

# Windows
start coverage-report/index.html

# Or use the file:// URL directly
file:///path/to/probot-sharp/coverage-report/index.html
```

### Performance Optimization

For large test suites:

1. **Parallel Test Execution**
   ```xml
   <RunSettings>
     <RunConfiguration>
       <MaxCpuCount>0</MaxCpuCount> <!-- Use all cores -->
     </RunConfiguration>
   </RunSettings>
   ```

2. **Exclude Slow Tests from Coverage**
   ```text
   using System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis;
   using Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UnitTesting;

   [TestClass]
   public class IntegrationTests
   {
       [TestCategory("SlowIntegration")]
       [ExcludeFromCodeCoverage]
       [TestMethod]
       public void LongRunningIntegrationTest() { }
   }
   ```

3. **Use Coverage Filters**
   ```bash
   # Only measure specific assemblies
   dotnet test --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage" \
     -- DataCollectionRunSettings.DataCollectors.DataCollector.Configuration.Include=[ProbotSharp.Domain]*
   ```

## Best Practices

1. **Run Coverage Regularly**
   - Before committing changes
   - In CI/CD pipeline
   - During code reviews

2. **Set Realistic Goals**
   - Start with current baseline
   - Improve incrementally
   - Focus on critical code first

3. **Don't Chase 100%**
   - Some code doesn't need testing (e.g., simple DTOs)
   - Focus on valuable tests, not coverage percentage
   - Quality over quantity

4. **Review Coverage in PRs**
   - Check coverage doesn't decrease
   - Ensure new code is tested
   - Look for untested edge cases

5. **Use Coverage as a Guide**
   - Identifies untested code
   - Highlights risky areas
   - Not the only measure of quality
